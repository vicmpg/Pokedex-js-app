A simple Pokédex Web App created with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript & Bootstrap.

It fetches data from an API (https://pokeapi.co) to display a list of items (Pokémons) and, upon clicking one of these items, opens up a modal with details about the chosen Pokémon.

Try it out!

1- Open the web app (https://github.com/vicmpg/Pokedex-js-app)
2- Click on a Pokémon of your choice (which you can find by typing its name into the search bar)
3- Read through the info in the modal: you should see its name, an image, its powers and its height
4- Click next to the modal, press ESC or click the close button to close the modal
5- Open another one if you like! You can refresh the web app by pressing enter once the search bar is empty again or by clicking on the Pokédex logo.

If you'd like to find out more about the developer (me), click on any of the social media links (LinkedIn, Github) or open up my portfolio by clicking on the folder icon on top or my logo in the footer.
